Frontend (React):
1.
Login Page:
• Create a login page with input fields for username and password.
• Upon submission, send a POST request to the backend with the entered credentials.
Authentication:
2.
• Receive response from the backend.
• If the credentials are correct, store the authentication token (MIT) in local storage or cookies for
subsequent requests.
• Redirect the user to the main application page.
Main Application Page:
3.
• Implement CRUD operations for events.
• Display a list of events fetched from the backend.
• Allow users to add new events, edit existing events, and delete events.
4.
CRUD Operations:
• Create: Provide a form to input event details and send a POST request to the backend to create a new
event.
• Read: Fetch the list of events from the backend and display them on the page.
• Update: Allow users to edit event details and send a PUT request to the backend to update the event.
• Delete: Allow users to delete events and send a DELETE request to the backend to remove the event.
5.
Logout:
• Provide a logout button that clears the authe - •-ation token from local storage or cookies.
• Redirect the user to the login page after logout.
Backend (Express):
Authentication Endpoint:
1.
• Create an endpoint for handling user login.
• Validate the username and password against a database or hardcoded values.
• If the credentials are correct, generate a JWT token and send it back to the client.
2.
CRUD API Endpoints for Events:
• Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on events (ag., lapi/events
• Handle POST requests to create new events, GET requests to retrieve events, PUT requests to update
events, and DELETE requests to delete events.
• Ensure that these endpoints are protected and can only be accessed with a valid JWT token.
3.
Middleware for Authentication:
• Create a middleware function to authenticate requests.
• Verify the -JINT token sent in the request headers.
• If the token is valid, allow the request to proceed; otherwise, return an unauthorized error.
4.
Dummy Data or Database Interaction:
• Use dummy data or connect to a database (like MongoDB) to store and retrieve event information.
This setup provides a basic foundation for implementing login/logout functionality with CRUD operations in a
React frontend and an Express backend. You can further enhance this by adding features like error handling,
input validation, and more sophisticated authentication mechanisms.
